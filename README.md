While UMD does not have a specific format for dissertation proposals, I feel it is nice to have a starting point when embarking on your proposal effort. This template is what I used when writing my proposal, and it was originally inspired by Michael Lam's template available on his website (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~lam/).

Feel free to use and make modifications as necessary.
